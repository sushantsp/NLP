I was so\\n&gt;intent on explaining how Jung thought we could be more moral than God that\\n&gt;I overlooked your main line of thought.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;You seem to be saying that, God being unknowable, His morality is unknowable.\\n\\nYep, that's pretty much it. I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the\\nJewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between\\nYHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral\\nCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries\\nfall, though.\\n\\nAs I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was\\nrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that\\nthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of\\nthe required Morality in all its nuances (-&gt;Talmud).\\n\\nThe essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between\\nMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate\\nanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).\\n\\n&gt;\\n&gt;The first thing that comes to mind is that man is supposed to be created\\n&gt;in His image, so there is an argument that we are committed to whatever\\n&gt;moral code He follows as part of trying to live up to that image.  If we\\n&gt;are supposed to live by Christ's example, you would be hard pressed to\\n&gt;argue that God is a \"do what I say, not what I do\" kind of guy.\\n\\nThe trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the \"created\\nin His image\" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and\\nhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if\\none wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors\\nunashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about\\nJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives\\nby his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.\\nRevelation aside, one can only \"know\" Christ second-hand or worse.\\n\\nThis is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way\\ninitially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible\\nto interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where\\nFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.\\n\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Metaphysically, if there are multiple moral codes then there is no\\n&gt;Absolute moral code, and I think this is theologically questionable.\\n\\nNo. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple\\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\\nthe child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if\\nthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\"\\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\\nanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\\nhe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\\nyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive\\nas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.\\n\\nDavid.\\n\\n---\\nOn religion:\\n\\n\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,\\nAs they swam its clearness through.\\n\\n</td>\n",

However, the rumors\\n&gt;I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\\n&gt;seems more likely.\\n\\nYo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the \"External Tank\" and\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\noptions list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\nthat O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\ntoday's Times).\\n\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's\\n     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&amp;C\\n     Communications, &amp; Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability &amp; EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA &amp; ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics &amp; Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.\\n\\nOption C - Single Core Launch Station.\\nThis is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\\ncylinder that's 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\\nthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \\nregular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\\nmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:\\n  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\\n  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\\n  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\\n    micrometeroid &amp; orbital debris)\\n  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\\n  - 7 berthing ports\\n  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\\n    (twice the volume of skylab).\\n  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\\n  - 10 kW of housekeeping power\\n  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\\n    loops, dual environmental control &amp; life support system)\\n  - increased crew time for utilization\\n  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\\n</td>\n",

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\"\\n \\n That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n======================================================================== 32\\n \\nI live in Idaho.

I hear that they're called\\n&gt;&gt; &gt;'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool?\\n&gt;Great Explaination, however you left off one detail, why do you always\\n&gt;see them at nuclear plants, but not always at fossil fuel plants.  At\\n&gt;nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereas\\n&gt;fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot\\n&gt;water.  As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many\\n&gt;fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive\\n&gt;contamination.\\n\\n       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual \\nboiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There's a gripe in the industry\\nthat nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's\\nmore important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system\\nas cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  \\n\\n       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they\\nusually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the\\nway down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\\nrather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal \\npollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".  \\n\\n       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is \\npurified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when\\nthe water boils.

A war was started when several armies invaded Israel,\\n&gt;&gt;vowing to drive the Jews into the sea.  Most Jews wanted to live in\\n&gt;&gt;peace, and the Arabs who stayed in Israel were granted citizenship.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;It depends entirely on how you define 'war'. The actual fighting largely\\n&gt;predates the Arab invasions - after all Deir Yassin happened in midApril\\n&gt;well before the Arab invasion. As I have said elsewhere Lt Col Lorch has\\n&gt;said that Hagana forces were fighting well before the Arabs invaded as in\\n&gt;months before. As for Jews wanting to live in peace that to is entirely\\n&gt;arguable. I think it is easy enough to show that the Labour party leadership\\n&gt;had no such intention at all. As for the Arabs who 'stayed' don't you mean\\n&gt;those who were not expelled? Even some of those who did 'stay' were not\\n&gt;granted citizenship but expelled after the fighting had stopped anyway.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Joseph Askew\\n&gt;\\n\\nHow do you define war?

Depends on WHY it misfired....\\n\\n&gt; - A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,\\n&gt;   but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.\\n\\nI can't imagine doing much combat type shooting single action.....\\n\\n&gt; - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again\\n&gt;   to rotate to the next round.\\n\\nAssuming the cylinder WILL rotate....\\n\\n&gt; - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the\\n&gt;   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an\\n&gt;   easy motion, even one handed.\\n\\nNever hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you've got one of those\\n'new fangled' hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties, it's unnecessarily\\nredundant.  I'd rather have the extra round.\\n\\n&gt; - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\\n&gt;   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\\n\\nQuite true.  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around\\nthan magazines though.\\n\\n&gt; - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell\\n&gt;   first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often\\n&gt;   lost as you realize \"hey, it's jammed!\" before starting to do anything\\n&gt;   about clearing it.\\n\\nTrue, but this is a training function.\\n\\n&gt; - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round\\n&gt;   and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the\\n&gt;   chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider\\n&gt;   this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed\\n&gt;   of employment as a revolver.\\n\\nCocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions\\nare the only carry modes that make sense...  The 80 series Colt's for\\nexample are quite safe to carry this way.\\n\\n&gt; - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\\n&gt;   operation of many of them requires more training.\\n\\nAgreed.\\n\\nNow that I've shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It\\nis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  On\\nthe other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the\\nyears.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high\\nprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds\\nto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.\\nAn auto?  Jack the slide and continue.\\n\\nI've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from\\nturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen\\nwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.\\n\\nMost revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sorts\\nof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a\\nblow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many\\nof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto\\ntake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely\\nto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight.\\nThe majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall\\ninto that category.\\n\\nVincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing\\nview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's \"The Semi\\nAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\"\\n\\nIn general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self\\ndefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination\\nthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi\\nauto effectively as a self defense arm.\\n\\nMost cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department\\nisn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their\\nown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of\\ntraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several\\ntimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother.\\n\\nFor myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pick\\nwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that day\\nand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!\\n\\nThat said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of\\nbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a\\nRuger or Smith revolver....

To pursue\\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\\n   which we must all live.\\n \\n                         OBJECTIVES\\n \\n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\\n   objectives shall be:\\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\\n            focus the education and participatory\\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\\n            of environmental concern;\\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\\n            their branches a full complement of program\\n            materials for their use, including suitable\\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\\n            desirable;\\n       (3)  To serve as a \"clearing house\" for the exchange\\n            of program ideas, materials and information\\n            among said organizations;  and\\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate through three \"Program Divisions\" serving youth in\\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\\nthrough formation of \"EnviroLeague Teams,\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by\\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\\n \\nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\\nyouth membership.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\\n \\nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \"draft\"\\nportions of the Mentor's Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\\nplace.\\n \\nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague's founder chose this\\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\\nForums.\\n \\nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe's Earth Forum - GO\\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \"EnviroLeague.\"\\n============================================================================\\n \\nSubsequently, EnviroLeague's Initial Governance Council has held its first\\nmeeting.

Although I think Bryan Murray is probably the best GM\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I have ever seen in hockey\\n&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;How do you figure that??  When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were\\n&gt;&gt;a pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked\\n&gt;&gt;unlikely to win it.  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for\\n&gt;&gt;the Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it.  A truly great GM would\\n&gt;&gt;have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon\\n&gt;&gt;of the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) can\\n&gt;&gt;maintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;When Jacques Demers brought the Wings to the conference finals twice a\\n&gt;few years back, he had everyone on the team giving 100 percent, but he \\n&gt;had very little talent.  He had Yzerman, Bob Probert (who had drinking\\n&gt;problems at the time), and a couple of decent goaltenders in Hanlon and\\n&gt;Stefan who got hot.  That's about it.  Can you name one player on those\\n&gt;earlier teams who even deserved to be in the all-star game, much less \\n&gt;actually got there, other than Yzerman and Probert?  Like, Petr Klima?\\n&gt;Give me a break!  When they faced Edmonton in both of those conference\\n&gt;finals, as hard as they played, it was clear they faced a team that simply\\n&gt;had superior talent to the Wings.  That's why they could not get to the\\n&gt;finals.  Also, at that time the Norris division was still the weakest \\n&gt;division in hockey, and getting past Chicago, and Toronto was not as\\n&gt;impressive as it is today.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Murray has brought scoring talent to the Wings that they did not have a\\n&gt;few years ago when Devellano was GM and Demers was coach.  To name a few,\\n&gt;Ysebaert, Kozlov, and Paul Coffey (who has made a definite positive impact on\\n&gt;the power play especially).  \\n\\n&gt;Murray has built one of the most talented teams in hockey at the present, with\\n&gt;the possible exception of the Pittsburgh Penguins.  The Wings have at least\\n&gt;five 30 goal scorers that I can think of, and a couple of defenseman with over\\n&gt;100 games worth of playoff experience.  Murray's one failing is that unlike\\n&gt;the other GM's you mentioned (who are definitely also good, don't get me\\n&gt;wrong), he has not found for himself a strong coach to motivate the team to\\n&gt;go out and give 100 percent for the full 60 minutes every night like they \\n&gt;did the last time they made a cup run.  When a team wins or loses, it's a\\n&gt;reflection of the GM *and* the coach, which was the point of my original \\n&gt;post.  If the team outmatches their opponent in terms of talent but loses\\n&gt;anyway (which has been the case this year when the Wings have struggled),\\n&gt;that indicates that the GM has done his job in building up the team but the\\n&gt;coach has failed to motivate them.  If, as in the case of the last run the\\n&gt;Wings made in the playoffs before Murray came, they gave opponents a hard\\n&gt;time who should have beaten them easily, that indicates good coaching making\\n&gt;up for a lack of talent.\\n\\nAll of this is fine.  I never said that Murray was a bad GM.  I merely said\\nthat he isn't the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor.\\nIf Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup\\nby now- probably more than once.  If he was as great a GM as you claim\\nand he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent\\nenough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.\\nBut Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM\\nso none of this is true anyway.\\n\\nGregmeister\\n\\n</td>\n",

I think\\nwe'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is\\nno \"option\" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs:\\nthere is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full\\n'040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA).\\nAnd there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other\\nthan the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one\\nof the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be\\ngetting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't\\nbe able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040.\\nIt's not an \"option.\"\\n    Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s\\nthinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot\\nrecognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for\\na FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or\\nsomething like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to\\nreplace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not\\nneed to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the\\nfull '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.\\n\\n-Hades\\n\\n</td>\n",

If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on\\nthe evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any\\npossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the\\nrather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere\\nis not self explanatory). \\n\\nChristians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, \\nwhich they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence\\nis the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The \\nevidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning\\non the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason\\nof the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly\\nconsistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the\\nevidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself\\nto us.\\n\\nIt is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come\\nthrough this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones\\nproviding evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be\\nphysical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for\\nall we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for\\nreason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired\\nin some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,\\nbelief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.\\n\\n&gt;You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.  However, if\\n&gt;we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone.  And since\\n&gt;we can only use faith, why is one picture of \"God\" (e.g. Hinduism) any less\\n&gt;valid than another (e.g. Christianity)?\\n&gt;\\nFaith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source \\nof evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings\\nhave many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and\\nsimilarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by\\nfaith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use\\nreason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding\\nof the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be\\nthe most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity\\nclaims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the\\nbest evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.\\n\\nIf you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while\\nand you will see rational debate aplenty.\\n-- \\n==============================================================================\\nMark Baker                  | \"The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but \\naa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts.\" -- C.

It is \\n   disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich\\n   or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed \\n   solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\\n\\nI agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc... is\\nnot terrorism.  That having been said, lets continue.\\n\\n   [snip]\\n   imagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \\n   to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\\n   in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\\n\\nI would not argue that all or even most of the villages are \"terrorist\\ncamps\".  There are however some which come very close to serving that\\npurpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way\\nprior to the invasion. \\n\\n   SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\n   the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\n   know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\n   suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\n   supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\n   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\n   for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\n   by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\n   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\n   are back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\n   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\n\\nSome of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you\\ndescribe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area,\\nbacked by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah\\nand Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation,\\nwhile mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate\\nbombing, which would have produced major casualties.\\n\\n   Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\n   we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\\n   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \\n   ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \\n   leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\\n\\nWell, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if\\nthe Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police\\nit and prevent further attacks.\\n\\n   This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\n   realize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\n   its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\n   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\n   would have resulted in.  \\n\\nActually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no\\nlonger civilian and now primarily military though.\\n\\n   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\n   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\n   circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\n   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\n   in all other parts of Lebanon.\\n\\nNo, the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another\\nLebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.\\n\\n   I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\\n   CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\\n\\nNo, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation.\\n\\n--\\nShai Guday              | Stealth bombers,\\nOS Software Engineer    |\\nThinking Machines Corp. |\\tthe winged ninjas of the skies.\\nCambridge, MA           |\\n</td>\n",

(i realize\\nthis is a real subjective question, but i've only played around with the\\nmachines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody\\nwho actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful).\\n\\n* how well does hellcats perform?  ;)\\n\\nthanks a bunch in advance for any info - if you could email, i'll post a\\nsummary (news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the\\ncorner... :( )\\n--\\nTom Willis  \\  twillis@ecn.purdue.edu    \\    Purdue Electrical Engineering\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies.\"  - F.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\"\\n \\n That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n======================================================================== 32\\n \\nI live in Idaho.

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the\\n\\tlow gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and\\n\\twould like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's\\n\\tanother curve approaching)\\n\\n3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is\\n\\tdepressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern\\n\\telectronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.\\n\\tthis is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about\\n\\tto turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as\\n\\tlittle as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.\\n\\nalso, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage\\nthan a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that\\nthe idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a\\nbig assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to\\nuse for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an\\ninattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a\\n5 speed)?  \\n\\nhow many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best\\ngear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will\\nbe some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with\\nall possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do\\nbetter.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved\\nwrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,\\nlow revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high\\nrevs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if\\none sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.\\n\\n\\neliot\\n</td>\n",

              "0   From: lerxst@wam.umd.edu (where's my thing)\\nSubject: WHAT car is this!?\\nNntp-Posting-Host: rac3.wam.umd.edu\\nOrganization: University of Maryland, College Park\\nLines: 15\\n\\n I was wondering if anyone out there could enlighten me on this car I saw\\nthe other day. It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/\\nearly 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really small. In addition,\\nthe front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is \\nall I know. If anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years\\nof production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you\\nhave on this funky looking car, please e-mail.\\n\\nThanks,\\n- IL\\n

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\"\\n \\n That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n======================================================================== 32\\n \\nI live in Idaho.

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the\\n\\tlow gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and\\n\\twould like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's\\n\\tanother curve approaching)\\n\\n3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is\\n\\tdepressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern\\n\\telectronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.\\n\\tthis is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about\\n\\tto turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as\\n\\tlittle as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.\\n\\nalso, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage\\nthan a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that\\nthe idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a\\nbig assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to\\nuse for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an\\ninattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a\\n5 speed)?  \\n\\nhow many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best\\ngear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will\\nbe some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with\\nall possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do\\nbetter.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved\\nwrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,\\nlow revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high\\nrevs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if\\none sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.\\n\\n\\neliot\\n

It took me a\\n&gt; good 20 minutes to start using them in your own app.\\n\\nI certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF, and it usually works\\nvery well.  That's not my point.  I'm &gt;philosophically&lt; opposed to it\\nbecause of its complexity.\\n\\nThis complexity has led to some programs' poor TIFF writers making\\nsome very bizarre files, other programs' inability to load TIFF\\nimages (though they'll save them, of course), and a general\\ninability to interchange images between different environments\\ndespite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.\\n\\nAs the saying goes, \"It's not me I'm worried about- it's all the\\n&gt;other&lt;  assholes out there!\"  I've had big trouble with misuse and\\nabuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and\\nunnecessary) complexity of the format.\\n\\nIn the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized\\nemphasis mine):\\n\\n\"The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed\\nto be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a\\nfair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in\\nthis specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB),\\nand that is currently the only way you can be &gt;sure&lt; that you will be\\nable to import any TIFF image, since there are so many\\nimage-generating applications out there now.\"\\n\\n\\nIf a program (or worse all applications) can't read &gt;every&lt; TIFF\\nimage, that means there are some it won't- some that I might have to\\ndeal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?  I\\ndon't and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not\\nthat anyone does, of course! :-)\\n\\nab\\n</td>\n",

Although I think Bryan Murray is probably the best GM\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I have ever seen in hockey\\n&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;How do you figure that??  When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were\\n&gt;&gt;a pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked\\n&gt;&gt;unlikely to win it.  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for\\n&gt;&gt;the Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it.  A truly great GM would\\n&gt;&gt;have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon\\n&gt;&gt;of the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) can\\n&gt;&gt;maintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;When Jacques Demers brought the Wings to the conference finals twice a\\n&gt;few years back, he had everyone on the team giving 100 percent, but he \\n&gt;had very little talent.  He had Yzerman, Bob Probert (who had drinking\\n&gt;problems at the time), and a couple of decent goaltenders in Hanlon and\\n&gt;Stefan who got hot.  That's about it.  Can you name one player on those\\n&gt;earlier teams who even deserved to be in the all-star game, much less \\n&gt;actually got there, other than Yzerman and Probert?  Like, Petr Klima?\\n&gt;Give me a break!  When they faced Edmonton in both of those conference\\n&gt;finals, as hard as they played, it was clear they faced a team that simply\\n&gt;had superior talent to the Wings.  That's why they could not get to the\\n&gt;finals.  Also, at that time the Norris division was still the weakest \\n&gt;division in hockey, and getting past Chicago, and Toronto was not as\\n&gt;impressive as it is today.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Murray has brought scoring talent to the Wings that they did not have a\\n&gt;few years ago when Devellano was GM and Demers was coach.  To name a few,\\n&gt;Ysebaert, Kozlov, and Paul Coffey (who has made a definite positive impact on\\n&gt;the power play especially).  \\n\\n&gt;Murray has built one of the most talented teams in hockey at the present, with\\n&gt;the possible exception of the Pittsburgh Penguins.  The Wings have at least\\n&gt;five 30 goal scorers that I can think of, and a couple of defenseman with over\\n&gt;100 games worth of playoff experience.  Murray's one failing is that unlike\\n&gt;the other GM's you mentioned (who are definitely also good, don't get me\\n&gt;wrong), he has not found for himself a strong coach to motivate the team to\\n&gt;go out and give 100 percent for the full 60 minutes every night like they \\n&gt;did the last time they made a cup run.  When a team wins or loses, it's a\\n&gt;reflection of the GM *and* the coach, which was the point of my original \\n&gt;post.  If the team outmatches their opponent in terms of talent but loses\\n&gt;anyway (which has been the case this year when the Wings have struggled),\\n&gt;that indicates that the GM has done his job in building up the team but the\\n&gt;coach has failed to motivate them.  If, as in the case of the last run the\\n&gt;Wings made in the playoffs before Murray came, they gave opponents a hard\\n&gt;time who should have beaten them easily, that indicates good coaching making\\n&gt;up for a lack of talent.\\n\\nAll of this is fine.  I never said that Murray was a bad GM.  I merely said\\nthat he isn't the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor.\\nIf Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup\\nby now- probably more than once.  If he was as great a GM as you claim\\nand he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent\\nenough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.\\nBut Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM\\nso none of this is true anyway.\\n\\nGregmeister\\n\\n</td>\n",

This is second hand, so I don't know how true it is, but I have\\nno reason to doubt it either.\\n\\nBradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge\\nhockey team.  The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I can't remember his name)\\neither owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the\\nBradley Center.\\n\\nSupposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but \\nturned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too\\nhigh.\\n\\nLike I said, I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but if\\nit's true, don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.  The Admirals\\naren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club\\nand a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBA's\\nMilwaukee Bucks play there as well.\\n\\nCharlie Betz\\nCray Research, Inc.

This is second hand, so I don't know how true it is, but I have\\nno reason to doubt it either.\\n\\nBradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge\\nhockey team.

            "From (Charles Betz x66442 CFENG) Subject NHL team in Milwaukee Lines 24 NntpPostingHost radioman.cray.com Organization Cray Research, Inc. After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that Milwaukee should have an NHL team, I thought Id pass along a story I heard recently. This is second hand, so I dont know how true it is, but I have no reason to doubt it either. Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge hockey team. The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I cant remember his name) either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the Bradley Center. Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too high. Like I said, I dont know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but if its true, dont look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon. The Admirals arent going to be forced out of the building and you wont see an NHL club and a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBAs Milwaukee Bucks play there as well.

It took me a\\n&gt; good 20 minutes to start using them in your own app.\\n\\nI certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF, and it usually works\\nvery well.  That's not my point.  I'm &gt;philosophically&lt; opposed to it\\nbecause of its complexity.\\n\\nThis complexity has led to some programs' poor TIFF writers making\\nsome very bizarre files, other programs' inability to load TIFF\\nimages (though they'll save them, of course), and a general\\ninability to interchange images between different environments\\ndespite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.\\n\\nAs the saying goes, \"It's not me I'm worried about- it's all the\\n&gt;other&lt;  assholes out there!\"  I've had big trouble with misuse and\\nabuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and\\nunnecessary) complexity of the format.\\n\\nIn the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized\\nemphasis mine):\\n\\n\"The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed\\nto be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a\\nfair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in\\nthis specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB),\\nand that is currently the only way you can be &gt;sure&lt; that you will be\\nable to import any TIFF image, since there are so many\\nimage-generating applications out there now.\"\\n\\n\\nIf a program (or worse all applications) can't read &gt;every&lt; TIFF\\nimage, that means there are some it won't- some that I might have to\\ndeal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?  I\\ndon't and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not\\nthat anyone does, of course! :-)\\n\\nab\\n</td>\n",

Although I think Bryan Murray is probably the best GM\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I have ever seen in hockey\\n&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;How do you figure that??  When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were\\n&gt;&gt;a pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked\\n&gt;&gt;unlikely to win it.  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for\\n&gt;&gt;the Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it.  A truly great GM would\\n&gt;&gt;have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon\\n&gt;&gt;of the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) can\\n&gt;&gt;maintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;When Jacques Demers brought the Wings to the conference finals twice a\\n&gt;few years back, he had everyone on the team giving 100 percent, but he \\n&gt;had very little talent.  He had Yzerman, Bob Probert (who had drinking\\n&gt;problems at the time), and a couple of decent goaltenders in Hanlon and\\n&gt;Stefan who got hot.  That's about it.  Can you name one player on those\\n&gt;earlier teams who even deserved to be in the all-star game, much less \\n&gt;actually got there, other than Yzerman and Probert?  Like, Petr Klima?\\n&gt;Give me a break!  When they faced Edmonton in both of those conference\\n&gt;finals, as hard as they played, it was clear they faced a team that simply\\n&gt;had superior talent to the Wings.  That's why they could not get to the\\n&gt;finals.  Also, at that time the Norris division was still the weakest \\n&gt;division in hockey, and getting past Chicago, and Toronto was not as\\n&gt;impressive as it is today.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Murray has brought scoring talent to the Wings that they did not have a\\n&gt;few years ago when Devellano was GM and Demers was coach.  To name a few,\\n&gt;Ysebaert, Kozlov, and Paul Coffey (who has made a definite positive impact on\\n&gt;the power play especially).  \\n\\n&gt;Murray has built one of the most talented teams in hockey at the present, with\\n&gt;the possible exception of the Pittsburgh Penguins.  The Wings have at least\\n&gt;five 30 goal scorers that I can think of, and a couple of defenseman with over\\n&gt;100 games worth of playoff experience.  Murray's one failing is that unlike\\n&gt;the other GM's you mentioned (who are definitely also good, don't get me\\n&gt;wrong), he has not found for himself a strong coach to motivate the team to\\n&gt;go out and give 100 percent for the full 60 minutes every night like they \\n&gt;did the last time they made a cup run.  When a team wins or loses, it's a\\n&gt;reflection of the GM *and* the coach, which was the point of my original \\n&gt;post.  If the team outmatches their opponent in terms of talent but loses\\n&gt;anyway (which has been the case this year when the Wings have struggled),\\n&gt;that indicates that the GM has done his job in building up the team but the\\n&gt;coach has failed to motivate them.  If, as in the case of the last run the\\n&gt;Wings made in the playoffs before Murray came, they gave opponents a hard\\n&gt;time who should have beaten them easily, that indicates good coaching making\\n&gt;up for a lack of talent.\\n\\nAll of this is fine.  I never said that Murray was a bad GM.  I merely said\\nthat he isn't the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor.\\nIf Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup\\nby now- probably more than once.  If he was as great a GM as you claim\\nand he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent\\nenough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.\\nBut Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM\\nso none of this is true anyway.\\n\\nGregmeister\\n\\n</td>\n",

This is second hand, so I don't know how true it is, but I have\\nno reason to doubt it either.\\n\\nBradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge\\nhockey team.  The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I can't remember his name)\\neither owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the\\nBradley Center.\\n\\nSupposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but \\nturned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too\\nhigh.\\n\\nLike I said, I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but if\\nit's true, don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.  The Admirals\\naren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club\\nand a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBA's\\nMilwaukee Bucks play there as well.\\n\\nCharlie Betz\\nCray Research, Inc.

I'm >philosophically< opposed to it\\nbecause of its complexity.\\n\\nThis complexity has led to some programs' poor TIFF writers making\\nsome very bizarre files, other programs' inability to load TIFF\\nimages (though they'll save them, of course), and a general\\ninability to interchange images between different environments\\ndespite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.\\n\\nAs the saying goes, \"It's not me I'm worried about- it's all the\\n>other<  assholes out there!\"  I've had big trouble with misuse and\\nabuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and\\nunnecessary) complexity of the format.\\n\\nIn the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized\\nemphasis mine):\\n\\n\"The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed\\nto be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a\\nfair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in\\nthis specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB),\\nand that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be\\nable to import any TIFF image, since there are so many\\nimage-generating applications out there now.\"\\n\\n\\nIf a program (or worse all applications) can't read >every< TIFF\\nimage, that means there are some it won't- some that I might have to\\ndeal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?  I\\ndon't and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not\\nthat anyone does, of course! :-)\\n\\nab\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ...  2    \n",

This is second hand, so I don't know how true it is, but I have\\nno reason to doubt it either.\\n\\nBradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge\\nhockey team.  The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I can't remember his name)\\neither owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the\\nBradley Center.\\n\\nSupposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but \\nturned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too\\nhigh.\\n\\nLike I said, I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but if\\nit's true, don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.  The Admirals\\naren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club\\nand a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBA's\\nMilwaukee Bucks play there as well.\\n\\nCharlie Betz\\nCray Research, Inc.
